# üîê Research Prompt: DexGuard and iXGuard by Guardsquare for React Native Banking App

## üéØ Objective

I need a detailed understanding of **DexGuard** (Android) and **iXGuard** (iOS) by **Guardsquare**, and how they can help secure a **React Native-based banking application**.

I already have PDF factsheets related to DexGuard and iXGuard, and I'm sharing a few important links below. Please refer to them and include their key takeaways in the final documentation. The goal is to create a **presentable and comprehensive Confluence document** that I can later use to explain their relevance to my team and stakeholders.
